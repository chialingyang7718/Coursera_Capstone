Although it is a smaller city compared to other international cities, the foreign cultures play an important role. I have been living in Zurich more than three years. Since there are more Asians living in this city in recent years, I think it would be a good idea to open a restaurant here. Therefore, I would like to know which \"Kreis\"(area) would be the best choice and at which price level should I set my menu, i.e. whether if I should open a high-classed restaurant or cheap take-away.

Also, residential areas and areas near workplaces should also be taken into account. Furthermore, the income of residents can also be regarded so that our target group can decide whether they are going to open a low-priced take-away or high-classed fancy restaurants.\n2.3 Information about rental: the less rental the less cost for the restaurant.

If the score is above 7, the area can be regarded as suitable. Between 4-7 is moderate and below 4 is unsuitable. In this way, we can cluster the \"Kreis\".",
